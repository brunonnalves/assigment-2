                The experience has been very positive. So far I haven't had any problems.
                I use the computer for work and it shows itself very stable even during long and heavy simulations.
                The comfort I get from the new PC, as well as the agility due to the higher performance,
                ended up moving me away from the notebook I used.
                Working on the notebook, which was once a routine, has now become a rare situation.
                Today I'm yielding dividends of the consultancy I did with you. I wouldn't change a thing, the machine was very well dimensioned.
