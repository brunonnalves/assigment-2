                    The rise of computer technology in the workplace over the past couple decades is astounding.
                    Possibly the greatest oversight with regard to this technology is the way our human bodies interact with the equipment.
                    When workstations are designed poorly, it often leads to fatigued, frustrated and hurting workers.
                    These workers are rarely the most productive, and they often develop costly and painful musculoskeletal (soft tissue)
                    injuries and disorders (MSDs).

                    PC is still the most cost-effective and customizable computers around.
                    We can customize PC settings for you to run your games and applications in a budget that suits you.<br>
                    In addition, instead of buying a new machine when your PC starts to show its age, you are able to incrementally update
                    as necessary, keeping your desktop up-to-date with the latest hardware. It enables you to do an upgrade plan and have a better
                    financial control.

                    Should you get a laptop or a desktop PC? It is a big choice that will ultimately determine what you can
                    and cannot do with your new computer.
                    While a gaming laptop is smaller and portable, a gaming desktop is larger and more customizable.<br>
                    Modern gaming laptops can be incredibly efficient and powerful. Though desktops can still have a performance
                    edge when it comes to high-end components and thermal considerations.<br>
                    On many laptops the processor and graphics card are soldered onto the motherboard, or are prohibitively difficult to access.
                    Desktops have the upper hand in hardware upgrade and maintenance, with easily accessible internal components.<br>
